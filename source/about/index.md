# About me

Currently on an adventure of a lifetime, living out of a 7kg cabin luggage bag and traveling the world. 

I left permanent employment in April 2018 after 9 years working with code and have started this blog for personal projects for the interim period between permanent employment. It will probably consist mostly of Kaggle competitons, reflections on what I've learnt from previous employment, and anything new I learn along the way.
